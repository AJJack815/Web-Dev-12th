  <h2> Class Practices</h2>
  <div class="one">
    <h3> <a href="Practice1A/start.html"> Practice 1A </a>and <a href="Practice1B/index.html">1B</a></h3>
    <p> 1A was just a tiny bit of HTML, using a paragraph, and understanding minor tags, while 1B we marked up a chunk of text using HTML, and also learned about lists. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="two">
    <h3> <a href="Practice2/cactus.html">Practice 2</a></h3>
    <p> We started with a file called cactus.html, and then we fixed everything that was wrong, it started off as some things being bolded, and some other things were off about it.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="three">
    <h3> <a href="Practice3/index.html">Practice 3</a></h3>
    <p> In Practice 3 we learned to link to other pages, and pracitced with it, as well as learning to link to spaces in the same html page using 'id' attributes. This has been the most unique that weve done thus far.</p>
