    <p> I had 4 different sites to do a critque of. With set questions. The questions were mainly asking us about the layout and color themes of the pages, and how they handled navigation.<p>

    <h3> <a href="Projects/Project2"> *Fake* Rent-A-Pet </a></h3>
    <p> Rent-A-Pet Is a website in which they rent out animals for the day. Some people love their animals, but work too much during the day to be able to take proper care of them; and others want to take care of an animal for a short amount of time without the repsonibility.</p>

  <div class="Project3">
    <h3><a href="Projects/Project3/about_us.html"> Continuation of Rent-A-pet</a></h3>
    <br>
    <p> We continued to work on the fake website we created, and this time we added CSS internal styles to style it, it now has a set
      color scheme.
