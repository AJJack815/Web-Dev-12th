  <p> We started our journey on CSS we started to work on inline and embedded styles, instead of an external css sheet.There isnt a whole lot to this, and its pretty simple, we just styled a sheet of marked up text for us.</p>
  </div>
   </div>
   <div class="Practice4B">
   <h3> <a href="Practice4B/cssproperties.html"> Practice 4B </a> </h3>
   <p> This is just playing with borders, and making sure we understand what borders are, and how they do what they do. very easy. </p>
   </div>
   <div class="Practice5">
   <h3><a href="Practice5/index.html"> Practice 5</a> </h3>
<<<<<<< HEAD
   <p> This was a larger practice, where we figured out how to make images into links, and change the colors of some things </p>
=======
     <p> This is mainly just telling us how to link an image in HTML, and how to use a picture to link to a different page, whatever is on that page is depenant on something else within the HTML. This is again pretty simple and basic. </p>
