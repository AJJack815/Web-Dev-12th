   <h3><a href="Practice4A/index.html"> Practice 4A</a> </h3>
  <p> We started our journey on CSS we started to work on inline and embedded styles, instead of an external css sheet.There isnt a whole lot to this, and its pretty simple, we just styled a sheet of marked up text for us.</p>
  </div>
   </div>
   <div class="Practice4B">
   <h3> <a href="Practice4B/cssproperties.html"> Practice 4B </a> </h3>
   <p> This is just playing with borders, and making sure we understand what borders are, and how they do what they do. very easy. </p>
   </div>
   <div class="Practice4C">
    <h3> <a href="Practice4C/CSS3Fonts.html"> Practice 4C </a> </h3>

    <br>
    <br>
   <div class="Practice5">
   <h3><a href="Practice5/index.html"> Practice 5</a> </h3>
   <p> This was a larger practice, where we figured out how to make images into links, and change the colors of some things
    <br> This is mainly just telling us how to link an image in HTML, and how to use a picture to link to a different page, whatever is on that page is depenant on something else within the HTML. This is again pretty simple and basic. </p>
   </div>
   <div class="Practice6">
    <h3><a href="Practice6/table.html"> Practice 6</a> </h3>
   <p> Today we are learning about a table, and learning how to deal with them</p>
